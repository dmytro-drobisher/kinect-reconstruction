This is a toy project to test scene reconstruction and visual odometry in OpenCV and Open3D. It uses a kinect v1 model 1414 with libfreenect for RGBD data capture.

Controls:

* Space - capture frame
* x - stop capture and begin reconstruction

Output is saved in pcd.ply which can be viewed in Open3D or Meshlab
